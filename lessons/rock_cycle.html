<h1>Rock Cycle</h1>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1'>
<p>
When we talk about a cycle in science, we are talking about something
that goes in a circle.
</p>
<p>
Many of you probably consider that all rocks are the same. A rock is
just a rock. You walk down the street and pick up a stone and it looks
like all the other stones that you may have picked up. The stones that
you pick up are fragments that came off a large rock. There are 3 major
types of rocks.  In this lesson, we will talk about each one
individually.
</p>
<p>
Scientist tell us that the Earth began as a huge ball of liquid rock.
Gradually this liquid cooled and turned into solid rock. This first
rock type is called Igneous. It means fire formed. There still is
liquid rock deep under the surface of the Earth. Some of this liquid
rock makes it to the Earth's surface. On the surface it is called Lava.
When this liquid rock is under the surface, it is called Magma.
</p>
<p>
There is a difference between Lava and Magma. Magma is liquid rock
beneath the Earth's surface and it contains dissolved gases. Lava is
liquid rock on the Earth's surface but it doesn't have dissolved gases.
As the magma hits the Earth's surface, the gases that were dissolved in
the liquid escape into the atmosphere. The more gases escaping the more
violent the eruption of the lava as it comes out of the Earth. As long
as the liquid rock is deep inside the Earth, the gases are not able to
escape due to the surrounding solid part of the Earth.
</p>
<p>
Before we go any further, we should mention that the Earth is divided
into 3 main layers. They are: Crust, Mantle, Core.
</p>
<div class='illustration'>
<img src="/assets/rock_cycle/crust-mantle-core-845bea221467f049995ac448c8ccac34570210a0522c82b67006561f911ccc0e.png" alt="Crust mantle core" />
</div>
<p>The Crust is mainly solid but it does contain the water of the Earth.</p>
<p>
The mantle is not a solid and not a liquid. It is pliable. Almost like
silly putty or maybe like a jello. The mantle material is able to flow
slowly.
</p>
<p>
The core is divided into 2 parts. The inner core is made of a solid
metal (iron and nickel). The layer around this inner core, the outer
core, is a liquid.
</p>
<p>
The magma  is in large chambers beneath the Earth's surface called
Magma Chambers. They are very hot. Like a hot air balloon, it begins to
rise up through the crust. It moves slowly. As it moves, some of the
rock above it will crack. The magma squirts up through these cracks.
When it reaches the surface, if it has a lot of dissolved gases, it
erupts on the surface and forms a volcano. If there isn't much
dissolved gas, the lava flows onto the surface and no volcano is
formed. The lava flow can cover hundreds of square miles and be very
thick. The reason for lava flow or volcano is the thickness of the
magma. If the magma is thick, it becomes a volcano; if the magma is
thin, it becomes a lava flow. What makes the magma thick or thin is the
amount of the mineral Quartz that is in the magma.
</p>
<p>
I just mentioned the word mineral. I have been using the word rock. Is
there a difference between a rock and a mineral ? Rocks are
mixture(aggregates) of minerals. Think of a chocolate chip cookie. It
is made up of cookie dough, chocolate chips and maybe some nuts. Each
of these ingredients is like a mineral (made up of one thing). The
chocolate chip cookie is like a rock ( made up of a bunch of other
things).  All rocks are mixture of minerals. Sometimes it is easy to
see all the ingredients that make up the rock but other times you can
not see the ingredients.
</p>
<p>
Since we are talking about igneous rocks, we will talk about the
ingredients in igneous rocks. As mentioned before, magma is liquid rock
beneath the Earths surface and lava is liquid rock on the surface of
the Earth. Sometime the magma gets stuck beneath the surface of the
Earth. When this happens the magma cools very slowly. Atoms in the
magma move around and combine with other atoms. The atoms grow into
minerals. These mineral become large enough to be seen by the eye.
Several different minerals form.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if the magma makes it to the surface of the Earth as
lava, it cools fast. Since it cools fast, the atoms don't have the
chance to move around much. They don't have the opportunity to form
minerals that can be seen by the eye.
</p>
<p>
Rocks that cool slow are called intrusive. You can see all the minerals
that make them up. An example of this type of rock called granite. The
two main ingredients in granite are feldspar and granite. There may be
many other minerals also. But if it doesn't have feldspar and quartz,
it is not called granite. Some of these intrusions, that formed miles
beneath the Earth's surface, are now found on the surface of the Earth.
You can see this if you visit Yosemite Park in California. These large
intrusions that are now visible to us were once miles beneath the
surface. The overlying rock was eroded away exposing the intrusions.
</p>
<p>
Rocks that cool fast are called extrusive. You can not see the
individual minerals with the naked eye. Lava is an extrusive rock.
There are different kinds of lava. Pumice is a lava that has so many
air pockets that it can float in water. Obsidian is a type of lava that
cooled extremely fast.  Obsidian looks like glass.
</p>
<p>
(A good experiment to do at this time is to grow crystals. )
</p>
<p>
Do the following: Boil some water. You can use different chemicals to
grow crystals of different shapes. Good safe chemicals that give good
crystals are: table salt, epsom salt, and alum. (you can buy alum at
most drug stores)
</p>
<p>
Use 400 ml beakers or equivalent. Fill the beakers 1/2 way with boiling
water. Add a spoonful of one of the chemicals and stir until it
dissolves.  Continue doing this until no more of the chemical will
dissolve. Pour the liquid into two other beakers. Do not pour the
sediment at the bottom of the beaker into the two beakers. Place one
beaker in the refrigerator and place the other beaker on the counter
top. Let them set over night -- if you did not dissolve enough chemical
into the boiling water it may take a couple of days. Look at the
beakers daily. the one that cooled slowly should grow crystals large
enough to be seen by the eye. Do this for all the chemicals. Have
students view the crystals and make drawings of the
individual crystals.
</p>
<h2>Volcanoes</h2>
<p>There are 3 main types of volcanoes.</p>
<h3>Type of Volcanoes</h3>
<h4>1. Cinder Cone</h4>

<div class='description'>Lava that flowed into the ocean</div>
</div>
<h4>3. Strato Volcano</h4>
<p>High and Steep</p>
<p>
Made up of alternate layers of lava that was thrown up into the air, which
solidifies before it hits the ground, and lava that flows onto the earth’s
surface. The flowing lava also solidifies but becomes much harder. Very
explosive and dangerous.
</p>
<div class='illustration'>

</div>
<h2>Sedimentary Rock</h2>
<p>
Everything that we have been talking about is Igneous Rock. Remember we
started out with the Earth being a huge ball of liquid rock. This rock
began to cool, volcanoes formed; the volcanoes gave off gases and water
vapor. The Earth began to develop an atmosphere. Clouds formed and rain
fell. Water started run across the surface. Rivers formed, lakes formed,
and the oceans formed. Once the water and the atmosphere formed, weathering
(erosion) began.
</p>
<div class='illustration'>
<img src="/assets/rock_cycle/igneous-rock-4019b79476408030d0def3f6bab59fcba72571d1b1bd6dd145eb716e01c1ea5b.png" alt="Igneous rock" />
</div>
<p>
The weathering wears down the igneous rock and forms fragment (small
pieces). These small pieces can be the size of dust, sand, gravel, or even
boulders. These smaller pieces are what we call a Sediment.
</p>
<p>
The sediment gets washed down stream by flowing water. It eventually gets
carried to the oceans. The Earth began 4 1/2 billion years ago. The
sediment piled up for millions of years on the floor of the oceans. This
meant that the thickness of the sediment reached  thousands of feet.
</p>
<p>
The sediment at the bottom of the pile was compressed (squashed) by the
overlying sediment. The ocean water had dissolved minerals in it. Two of
the minerals are quartz and calcite. These two minerals act as a cementing
agent (glue). If there was no cementing agent, it would be like trying to
build a sand castle with dry sand. The sediment at the bottom of this pile
is now turned into rock --- Sedimentary Rock. The process of changing a
sediment to sedimentary rock is called Lithification.
</p>
<div class='illustration'>

</div>
<h3>Sedimentary Rock</h3>
<p>
There are many different kinds of sediments and consequently different
kinds of sedimentary rocks. An easy way to understand how different
sediments are formed is to understand the process called sorting. Consider
a flowing body of water, like a river, flowing into a large body of water,
like an ocean. The river flows down a hill and due to its velocity (speed)
it will pick up various size particles; from very fine grains, like found
in dirt, to gravel size grains. As the river enters the ocean the water
velocity slows up. Since the velocity of the water decreases, it can not
carry all the material that it did when it was traveling faster. The
heaviest material that the river carried is the first material to be
deposited. The smallest and lightest material is carried the furthest out
into the ocean.
</p>
<h3>Sorting</h3>
<div class='illustration'>

</div>
<p>
This sediment will eventually be turned into sedimentary rock.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Sand is changed to the rock called Sandstone</li>
<li>Silt is changed to the rock called Shale</li>
<li>
The real fine material is mixed with the remains of sea creatures
(bones &amp; shells) to form the rock called Limestone.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Since limestone is made up of the remains of many sea creatures, limestone
has lots of fossils in it. All of the sedimentary rocks can contain
fossils. Fossils are any record of past life.
</p>
<h3>Metamorphic Rock</h3>
<p>
Keep in mind that the sedimentary rock found at the bottom of the ocean
goes deep into the crust of the Earth. The crust of the Earth is about 30
miles thick. As was mentioned earlier, when we talked about igneous rock,
there are large magma chambers rising up through the crust. These magma
chambers are very hot. The surrounding sedimentary is heated up and baked.
The closer the sedimentary rock is to the magma chamber, the hotter it is.
This rock is also under tremendous pressure from the overlying rock. This
rock is baked. It has changed. It is now called Metamorphic Rock.
</p>
<div class='illustration'>
<img src="/assets/rock_cycle/metamorphic-rock-1eb5ede33d9c4876efa3966eda38f0e200015186d7b0cfc3312cb4726c166a3c.png" alt="Metamorphic rock" />
</div>
<ol>
<li>Sandstone is changed to Quartzite</li>
<li>Shale is changed to Slate</li>
<li>Limestone is changed to Marble</li>
</ol>
<p>
Metamorphic rocks are much harder then the sedimentary rock.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the metamorphic rock get too hot and under more pressure, it will
become pliable -- like silly putty. When it is in this state, the atoms are
able to move around. Since the atoms are moving, they bump into other atoms
and new compounds and minerals are formed. With the higher temperatures and
pressures the slate can change into a rock called Schist. If the
temperature and pressure the schist is changed to Gneiss (pronounced nice).
</p>
<p>
If the temperature and pressure continue to rise, the metamorphic rock will
melt. It will become magma. This magma will eventually cool in place or
make it to the Earth's surface and cool. It is now an igneous rock.
</p>
<p>
We have gone around in a circle and are back at the beginning. This is the
Rock Cycle.
