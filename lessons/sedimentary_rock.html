<h1>Sedimentary Rock</h1>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1'>
<p>
Sedimentary Rock covers 75% of the Earth, but makes up only 5% of the crust.
</p>
<p>
Since sedimentary rock covers so much of the surface of the Earth, most
of us will encounter it almost on a daily basis. There was a time when
people saw all the various rocks, but they were not interested in how
they were made or how old they were. Those that did have an interest in
rocks did not always use proper scientific methods to understand them.
</p>
<p>
The last great teacher of the old fashion geology was Abraham Werner.
Werner believed that physical features such as mountains and valley
were formed by sudden spectacular events called <b>Catastrophes</b>.
During Werner's time, no one tried to explain how land forms came about
— except to say that mysterious forces within the Earth produces them.
</p>
<p>
A few people began to doubt Werner's teachings. One of these was a
Scottish physician and farmer by the name of James Hutton. Hutton
observed the action of streams that ran through valleys and saw that
running water moved dirt and pebbles down stream. He believed rivers cut
into the rocks of the hills and made valleys.
</p>
<p>
Hutton stated, "The Present Is The Key To The Past.""
</p>
<p>
Observe what geologic processes are happening today: they are the same
ones that occurred in past years. This is known as the Principle of
Uniformitarianism.
</p>
<p>There are 3 sources of Sedimentary Rocks</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Clastics</b>: made up of fragments from other rocks.</li>
<li><b>Chemical</b>: grains formed from evaporation, precipitation. or a chemical reaction.</li>
<li><b>Organic</b>: formed from the remains of plants and animals.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class='col-xs-12 text-center'>
<h2>Clastics</h2>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1'>
<p>
Clastic grains are broken off other rocks and then transported to a new
environment. The transporting agent can be:
<ul>
<li>Wind</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Gravity</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I think that we all have seen wind blowing dust or a muddy stream or
river. Fragments of rock are being transported. If the water is flowing
fast enough, larger fragments like sand and gravel are transported. In a
desert we have large sand storms transporting the fragments of rock. But
some of us might not be sure how gravity transports rock. You might see a
landslide along a highway or a large rock coming down the side of a hill
or mountain. What made them come down -- gravity.
</p>
<p>
Most of the rocks that are transported are not large rocks but smaller
fragments that broke off the bigger rocks. How did the fragments break off
the larger rock?
</p>
<p>
We will look at the factors that determine how these fragments are made.

<p>
Factors that determine how fast rocks weather:
<ol>
<li>Kind of Rock</li>
<li>Climate</li>
<li>Cracks in the rock</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The rocks that make fragments are the rocks that are exposed to weather.
Some rocks can withstand the weather better than others. So we must
consider the rock type. Granite for example is extremely hard. You can
beat on it with a hammer and find it difficult to break off a piece. But
on the other hand, doing the same thing to sandstone will give you lots
of little pieces. This is why we use granite for tombstones -- it does
not weather fast.
</p>
<p>
The fragments are held together by a cementing agent. This cementing
agent is usually the mineral quartz or calcite. Calcite is easily
dissolved by acid. In nature it is a mild acid called carbonic acid
(rain).
</p>
<p>
Climate has a lot to do with how fast a rock weathers. If the weather
conditions don't change, the rock is less likely to weather fast. If the
climate is rainy, rocks will weather faster. If the climate is season,
weathering is also faster.
</p>
<p>
Cracks in rocks permit water to get into the rock. If the temperature
goes down to freezing at night, the water will freeze. Freezing water
expands. This is like driving a wedge into the rock. If this happens
night after night, the rock will break. This is how potholes in the roads
are made.
</p>

<h2>Non-Clastics</h2>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1'>
<p>
Nonclastics are formed by chemical and organic processes.
</p>
<p>
Evaporates are formed by the evaporation of water
</p>
<p>
Example: halite (salt), gypsum (the white stuff in drywall)
</p>

<p>
Under lake Erie there is a hugh deposit of salt from a previous lake that
evaporated.
</p>
<p>
Rocks will decompose; this happens mostly in tropical areas
</p>
<p>Rain + CO₂ → Carbonic Acid (H₂O₃)</p>
<p>
When rain mixes with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it makes a weak
acid called carbonic acid. All rain is a mild acid. This should not be
confused with what we call Acid Rain (which is a stronger acid).
</p>
<p>
Carbonic acid will decay rocks: Granite changes to Clay
</p>
<p>
Limestone is mainly composed of the dead remains of sea creatures. The
bones of fish and shells from mollusks  are the main ingredients.
</p>
</div>
<div class='col-xs-12 text-center'>
<h2>Coal</h2>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1'>
<p>
Peat → Lignite → Bituminous Coal → Anthracite Coal
</p>
<p>
Coal starts out as trees and ferns in swamps. When they die, they are
covered by water. They don't decay the normal way. No insects to help
out. As more and more pile up the material is compressed. The material is
all organic. Made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The first step in
the formation of coal is Peat. When this is compressed more it forms
Lignite. This material is now mainly carbon and hydrogen. It will burn
but does not produce must heat. Under further pressure the Lignite is
Changed to Bituminous coal. This is the first true coal. It burns much
better than pollutant. When the sulfur combines with rain water it forms
sulfuric acid. This is what we call Acid Rain. If the bituminous coal
undergoes more pressure and is baked from the heat from magma, it changes
into Anthracite Coal. This is a clean burning coal with lots of heat and
very little air pollution. It is found in mountainous regions.

<h3>Special Sedimentary Features</h3>
<p>
<b>Strata</b>: This what each different layer of rock is called.

<b>Bedding Planes</b>: the division which separates the individual
layers (strata)
</p>
<p>
<b>Ripple Marks</b>: Found in bedding planes; marks left in the sand
or mud by wind or water (waves).
</p>
<p>
<b>Geodes</b>: Round cavities lined with crystals of quartz or
calcite.

<h2>Sorting</h2>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1'>
<p>
Sorting is separating. It's like sorting the laundry. Putting different
colors into different piles. Flowing water will do the same thing. When
the water is flowing fast, it carries all sizes of rock fragments. But
when the water slows, it can not carry the heavier rocks. So they are
dropped or deposited. As the water continues to slow, more and more rocks
are deposited. The smallest material is deposited last. More and more
material is deposited. The material piles up. The first material
deposited is compressed and eventually turned into rock. the drawing
below shows how all this is done.
</p>
<div class='illustration'>
<img src="/assets/sedimentary_rock/sorting-cc8a5ab774dcda975246d5fdca681c9569933f41ee001268772013411bdb3717.png" alt="Sorting" />
<div class='description'>Sorting Figure</div>
</div>

<p>
The grains are deposited based on their size and density.
</p>
<p>
During burial of the sediment, the loose material is consolidated by
pressure and a cementing agent such as Calcite or Quartz. This is called
Lithification.

The smaller the grains, the smaller the pores.
</p>
<p>
Porous rock can contain water. This type of rock is called an Aquifer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Permeable Rock</b>: water can pass through it.
<br>
<b>Impermeable Rock</b>: water can not pass through it.
</p>
<p>
Artesian wells are wells that are drilled into solid rock. The sandstone
(permeable) is sandwiched between two layers of impermeable rock(shale).
Water enters the rock from miles away. As  the water travels through the
rock, it is purified and it is put under pressure. When you drill into
the rock, you generally don't need a pump to get the water to the
surface. Since the water is under pressure, the pressure forces it to the
surface.

<p>
It was mentioned earlier that people that were interested in rocks did
not use scientific methods to understand them. For one thing, there
weren't scientific principles for use in geology. Listed below are some
simple but important principles that have been developed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Principle of Superposition</b>: the oldest rocks are found in the
lowest strata; we number the strata from the oldest to the youngest. The
lower the number, the older the rock.
</p>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3'><div class='illustration'>
<img src="/assets/sedimentary_rock/superposition-244b3fee98aeaf350a977f27da65c79f0213d96179442322faf26fae35858fca.png" alt="Superposition" />
<div class='description'>Super Position</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<b>Fossil Correlation</b>: the various strata can be identified by
the fossils that they contain.
</p>
<p>
Rock layers can be hundreds of miles long. If the strata is of the same
age, it will have the same type of fossils in it. If a layer of sandstone
form from the sand found on a beach, it is not likely to have fossils of
clams and camels in the same strata.
</p>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3'><div class='illustration'>

<div class='description'>Fossil Correlation</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Maybe you can see why Fossil Correlation is important. In the drawing
above, the rocks have been eroded. The center section has been eroded
away. If we try to match the rock strata on the left with the rock strata
on the right, do they all match up ? The rock type do but not the
fossils. Look at the 3rd layer from the top. They have two different
types of fossils. Therefore they are not of the same age. They did not
form at the same time.
</p>
<h2>Caverns</h2>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3'><div class='illustration'>
<img src="/assets/sedimentary_rock/caverns-a3ad8be83ba3e6db9bff86f33bc9b6263f77de6e98b43ec76cbe28afd965d946.png" alt="Caverns" />
<div class='description'>Caverns</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Limestone is a rock type that dissolves easier then most rocks. Rain
water is slightly acid(carbonic acid). Dissolving the calcite in the
limestone creates air pockets. If the limestone has cracks in it, the
water can make its way to great depts. As the water makes it way through
the limestone, the carbonic acid slowly dissolves the limestone and
carries ions away in solution. After thousands of years, the cracks
between beds become so large that they form networks of underground
tunnels, sometimes hundreds of miles long
</p>
<h2>Karst Topography</h2>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3'><div class='illustration'>
<img src="/assets/sedimentary_rock/karst-topography-5d06e1d47efe92f5b60fe6d2929c756aa62bcd73ef4af2ddb7bb775bd1ad22e7.png" alt="Karst topography" />
<div class='description'>Karst Topography</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
In limestone regions, most of the water sinks into the ground through
cracks and sinkholes. These regions generally have few surface rivers.
Lost rivers are formed when surface rivers disappear underground and flow
out of caves many miles away. Regions that contain many sinkholes,
sinkhole ponds, lost rivers, underground drainage, and natural bridges
are said to have Karst Topography. A sinkhole is nothing more than a
cavern that has collapsed.
</p>
<h2>Geyser</h2>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3'><div class='illustration'>
<img src="/assets/sedimentary_rock/geyser-1ac9a593548018434cd8c0636eab2dc9a3f69f99ab42f0eae1214eae7318c3f5.png" alt="Geyser" />
<div class='description'>Geyser</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Geysers are boiling hot springs that occasionally erupts. The geyser's
tubes have a lot of narrow tubes. They act as though they are blocking
the flow of water upward. Because of the constriction, the water at the
bottom of a geyser's tube is under pressure. The water becomes
superheated to a temperature above the boiling point. But due to the
pressure the superheated water can not turn to steam. Finally the water
becomes so hot that it overcomes the pressure and turns to steam. When
this happens, the steam forces some of the water up to the surface. The
pressure at the bottom of the tube is relieved, and the superheated water
explodes into steam. The steam blows out the water above it.
